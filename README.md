==================

Learning different effect systems by example

### Higher-order effects

- [fused-effects](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/): a fast, flexible, fused effect system.
- [polysemy](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy/): higher-order, no boilerplate, zero-cost monads.

### Distributed effects

- [transient](https://github.com/transient-haskell/transient): distributed, concurrent and parallel computations as primitives.

### Common effects

- [rio](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio): aka `ReaderT` + `IO`.
